# Android Application

## Project Overview
This project is an Android application that implements a login system and an image upload feature. It is built using modern Android development practices and utilizes popular libraries such as Retrofit for API calls and Glide for image handling. The application supports authentication and allows users to upload images after a successful login.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**. Ensure you have the following setup:
   - Compile SDK: 34
   - Java version: 1.8
   - Gradle version: 8.11.1
   - Minimum SDK: 24 (Android 7.0)

3. **Sync Gradle**: Once the project is opened, sync the Gradle files by clicking on the "Sync Now" prompt.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: You can run the application on an emulator or a physical Android device.
2. **Login**: Enter your username and password on the Login Screen (`MainActivity`) and click the login button.
3. **Image Upload**: After successful login, you will be directed to the Home Screen (`HomeActivity`), where you can select an image to upload from your gallery.

## Features

- **Login Functionality**:
  - Input fields for username and password
  - Error handling for API responses
  - Progress indicator during API calls

- **Image Upload**:
  - Option to pick an image from the gallery
  - Image compression feature before upload
  - Progress indicator during upload
  - Display success/error messages based on upload status

- **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out from the application.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following dependencies defined in the `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
// Retrofit for API calls
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'

// Image handling
implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0'

// Material Design
implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.9.0'
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Activities**:
   - `MainActivity`: This is the login screen of the application.
   - `HomeActivity`: The screen shown after successful login.

2. **API Service Interface**:
   ```java
   public interface ApiService {
       @POST("api.php?api=login")
       Call<LoginResponse> login(@Body LoginRequest request);
       
       @Multipart
       @POST("api.php?api=otp-image")
       Call<ImageUploadResponse> uploadImage(@Part MultipartBody.Part image);
   }
   ```

3. **Models**:
   - `LoginRequest`
   - `LoginResponse`
   - `ImageUploadResponse`

4. **SharedPreferences**: Used for storing the user login session.

## UI/UX Design

The application is designed with Material Design components to ensure a clean and modern interface. It includes:
- Proper error messages and loading states
- Responsive layout to accommodate various screen sizes

## Testing Plan

The application includes testing for:
1. **Login functionality**: testing success and error cases as well as network error handling.
2. **Image upload**: testing the file selection and handling of upload success/error scenarios, including network issues.

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:
1. Secure storage of user credentials.
2. All API calls are made over HTTPS.
3. Input validation to prevent vulnerabilities.
4. Proper session management after login.
